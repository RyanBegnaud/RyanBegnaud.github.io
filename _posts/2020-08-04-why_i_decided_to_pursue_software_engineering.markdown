There are a number of reasons I decided to pursue Software Engineering. In my life i've always enjoyed puzzles and puzzle games. I think getting to problem solve has always been second nature and something I really enjoy doing. I also really love getting to create things. I started programming in Java last August. From the minute I started I knew that I wanted to be a programmer. 

I've had jobs ranging from Sales to Hard labor that I never really enjoyed. So the idea of getting paid to do something I actually enjoy was a huge motivator for me and the main reason I decided to pursue Software Engineering!
