For my CLI project I decided to make something similar to Yelp but not Yelp exactly because for some reason that name was already taken. I decided I was going to use the Yelp Api to obtain the information I needed for my program. Getting the Api to work properly was a little bit of a challenge initially and took me some time to fully configure but it was easily worth it and it allowed me to gain some knowledge using API's. 

My project !Yelp allows the user to input a zip code for the area they would like to search for food. It then asks the user if they would like to search for a type of food or a specific restaurant. After obtaining the user's choices it takes that information and uses it to seach with the Yelp Api. It then takes the results and filters them to make sure that the restaurants are open. Afterwards I created a new object for each business and assigned that business's: Name, Address, Phone Number, Rating, Amount of reviews and Website to that object to later get displayed in a return to the user. 

Overall the project was a bit of a challenge but felt super rewarding to finish. It allowed me to put API's into practice and use what i've learned from Flatiron School so far (and it didn't even drive me insane!). I'm super excited for whatever is next and to continue to grow as a Programmer throughout the rest of this Bootcamp!!
