Over the past few weeks I have been working on a Sinatra Web application which I believe I fittingly named Cooking Made Simple. The App is a cooking site that allows users to share recipes. The App allows users to create new accounts and will save their information using session cookies so they don't have to repeatedly keep logging in as they navigate the application. Once an account is created it then allows the user to view all recipes that have been shared on the site, or add their own recipes to share with others. During the process of building this app out, I learned a lot of valuable information about working with Sinatra and i'm very glad I got the chance to work through this!!
