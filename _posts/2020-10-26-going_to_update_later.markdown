In this lesson you're going to build a complete Ruby on Rails application that manages related data through complex forms and RESTful routes. The goal of the application is to build a Content Management System, whether the content being managed is Blog Posts, Recipes, a Library of Resources, or any domain model that lends itself to these requirements (the majority of ideas you could come up with would probably meet the requirements).
